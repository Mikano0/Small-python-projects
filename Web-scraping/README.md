Web Scraping Practice

This repository is where I’m getting started with web scraping in Python.

I’m learning the basics of how to:

Fetch web pages using requests

Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup

Extract useful data like titles, links, and upvotes

I’ll be storing my practice files, small scripts, and experiments here as I learn and improve.

This repo is mainly for learning and tracking progress

Tools & Libraries

Python

requests

BeautifulSoup (bs4)

More updates to come as I continue learning.
