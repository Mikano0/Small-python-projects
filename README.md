🐍 Mikano0's Python Projects

Hello
This is a collection of my small Python projects. I created this repo to experiment, practice, and keep track of what I’m learning as I go.

---

📂 Projects

Each folder in this repo is a separate mini project. For example:

/calculator app
/todo-app
/small-game

These are all small programs that i'm making to see how far my skills have gotten during each day/week, i might be scaling these projects up to bigger projects over time but for now its a small unpolished project

✅ Progress Tracker

Here’s a quick snapshot of what I’ve been working on:

- [x] Set up this GitHub repo  
- [x] Create project structure  
- [x] Create a small game  
- [x] Learn file handling (read/write)  
- [x] Practice basic data structures  
- [x] Try some error handling exercises
- [x] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Learn classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation
- [x] JSON / Pandas file handling – Read, manipulate, and store structured data efficiently
- [x] APIs – Fetch and work with external data through RESTful APIs    <- Working on this now

Advanced / Future Goals
- [ ] Flask – Build simple web applications and understand routing, templates, and forms  
- [ ] Data visualization – Practice plotting data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn  
- [ ] Web scraping – Learn to extract data from websites using BeautifulSoup or similar tools
