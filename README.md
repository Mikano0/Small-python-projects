🐍 Mikano0's Python Projects

Hello
This is a collection of my small Python projects. I created this repo to experiment, practice, and keep track of what I’m learning as I go.

---

📂 Projects

Each folder in this repo is a separate mini project. For example:

/calculator app
/todo-app
/small-game

These are all small programs that i'm making to see how far my skills have gotten during each day/week, i might be scaling these projects up to bigger projects over time but for now its a small unpolished project

🧭 Learning Roadmap

Here’s roughly the path I’m following to get better at Python:

🟢 Beginner Topics
- [x] Variables & data types  
- [x] Printing to console / basic input/output  
- [x] Conditional statements (`if/else`)  
- [x] Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- [x] Functions & basic function design  
- [x] Small game projects to apply basics  

🟡 Current / Intermediate Topics
- [x] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – classes, objects, methods  
- [x] Lists & dictionaries  
- [x] File handling (read/write, text and CSV files)  
- [x] Modules & imports (organizing code into reusable parts)  
- [x] Debugging basics & error handling 
- [x] Data manipulation with Pandas
- [x] APIs – fetching and working with external data   <------- I am here
- [ ] Flask – building simple web apps with routing and templates   
- [ ] Data visualization – plotting with Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly  
- [x] Web scraping – extracting data from websites  

🔵 Future Goals
- [ ] More complex GUI projects (Tkinter, PyQt, or similar)  
- [ ] Full-stack web projects / automation scripts  
- [ ] Machine Learning basics – using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow  
- [ ] Working with databases – SQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL integration  
- [ ] Advanced web scraping & data pipelines  
- [ ] Deploying apps – making your Python projects accessible online  



▶️ How to Run the Projects

1. Open the project folder you want to try
2. Run the main file, usually like this:

```bash
python main.py
